        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Faris Shihada and I will talk about different types of storage devices. There are many different types of storage devices like: Hard Drives, Micro SD cards, SSDs, M.2 SSD Storage, and USB Thumb Drives.</p>

        <h2>2. Information</h2>
        <p>Storage is something that we normally use every day, and it is very important for your devices. Without storage devices, your device will not work at all.</p>

        <h2>3. Breaking Down Storage Devices</h2>
        <h3>Hard Drive</h3>
        <p>A hard drive is very complicated. It has many different parts, but we will only talk about the important ones for now. There are 7 important parts including disks for storage and the read/write arms.</p>

        <h3>M.2 SSD Storage</h3>
        <p>M.2 SSD Storage is complex and has multiple parts, including a turbo fan, aluminum fin, and heat sink to keep it cool.</p>

        <h3>SSD</h3>
        <p>An SSD is mainly used for storage and operating systems. It has a flash memory board, a controller, and a cache for fast access.</p>

        <h3>USB Thumb Drive</h3>
        <p>The USB Thumb Drive consists of a flash memory chip, a controller device, and a USB connector to transfer and store data.</p>

        <h3>SD Cards</h3>
        <p>SD cards mainly consist of flash memory, read/write pins, and a cache for identifying data when connected to a computer.</p>

        <h2>4. About Storage Devices</h2>
        <p>Each storage device has specific features and purposes, such as external storage, operating system support, and gaming performance.</p>

        <h2>5. Why Storage Devices?</h2>
        <p>Storage devices serve multiple purposes, including powering devices, storing data, and supporting operating systems.</p>
