    <h1>Storage devices</h1>

    <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Faris Shihada and I will talk about different types of storage devices.
    There are many different types of storage devices like: Hard Drives, Micro SD card, SSD, M.2 SSD Storage, and a USB Thumb Drive.</p>
    
    <h2>2 Information</h2>
    <p>Storage is something that we normally use every day, and storage is very important
    for your devices. Without storage devices, your device will not work at all.</p>
    
    <h2>3 Breaking down storage devices</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Hard Drive</h3>
    <p>A hard drive is very complicated; it has many different parts,
    but we will only talk about the important ones for now. So there are 7 important
    parts of a hard drive. It is the 3 disks which are for the storage but not really
    the storage; it is the one that holds the saved data. The arm will make it spin
    to transfer data or just load stuff up. It makes it spin very fast, and there are 3
    layers of the same thing, which is the disk and the saved data and the read and
    write arms.</p>
    
    <h3>2. M.2 SSD Storage</h3>
    <p>With M.2 SSD Storage, it is pretty complex. It has 6 parts. The first one is the
    turbo fan, which is a fan to keep the M.2 SSD cool because
    the M.2 SSD can get hot very fast and easily. They are at lightning speeds, and
    we call that a heat sink. The next part is the aluminum fin, which holds
    the turbo fan and has an opening to let the M.2 SSD get cool with the holder
    so it does not fall out. After that, we have the M.2
    SSD. With M.2, there is one very long part like a highlighter, and that is storage.
    Lastly, we have the bottom of the M.2 SSD, which has the job of keeping everything together with
    screws. You screw them in, and then you're good to go.</p>
    
    <h3>3. SSD</h3>
    <p>There are multiple uses for an SSD. It can be used for storage if
    wished, but it is not the main thing an SSD is used for. To store information/data
    with an SSD, you would have to connect it to a computer device. An example of
    an SSD being used is in Windows and/or macOS...</p>
    
    <h3>4. USB Thumb Drive</h3>
    <p>The USB Thumb drive only runs from only 4 parts. Starting
    with the flash memory chip that is working the most because it is the
    one working with the storage. The Controller device is used to read and write...</p>
    
    <h3>SD Cards</h3>
    <p>An SD card is mostly the flash memory and read and write. The pins on the
    back are the read and write, and inside the SD card is the flash memory...</p>
    
    
    
    <h2>5 Why Storage Devices</h2>
    <p>A storage drive serves multiple purposes, one of which is to provide power to
    your devices. The device you are currently using is powered
    by a storage device, specifically a robust one that supports all the software
    applications...</p>
